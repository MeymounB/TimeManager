# Users feedback

## Rejected

- Need to handle constraints schedules and display associated employees/managers/Accounting -> This means linking absolutely all data which may cause a security issue.
- Linked to bat signal -> Batman is not an employee

## Company Issues we can't act on

- Sometimes employee don't have enough work to do to ensure they make 100% of their working times. We can't add work if there is none.
- Overtime are not always paid or not equally between night/week-ends.
- Schedules are planned too late and not always follows business needs.
- Impression of hostile and incompetent management.
- The company must define its own clock policy (when to clock in/out).
- Unpaid working times may not be recorded/visible because these hours should be payed -> We are not doing this because it is illegal
- Every employee must have an access to a computer/mobile phone to clock in/out
- Easy for employee to declare false overtime -> The company should have trust in its employees

## Configurable actions/behaviors

- Night hours delimitations (start/stop)
- Work during lunch time taken as effective working time
- Time to move from office to office (either by walking or driving) as effective working time
- Night shift hour factor
- 40h+ hours factor

## Explain why usefull

- Explain how the app will improve productivity
- Put pression on employees -> It doesn't change anything, the employee will work the same amount of time. It may event be better because working time will be recorded.
- Lot of time for only small details -> Small improvements on every day will make hours of difference a year
